# The Pedagogy of Problem-solving

## Status quo

If problem-solving is the centerpiece of mathematics education at schools, what are teachers expected to teach? Before we try to answer this question, let us pause for a moment and see what happens in a classroom on some given day. Let us say the class is discussing algebraic identities. If the word *discussing* sounds too far-fetched, please correct it to something less democratic. The learners are familiar with most of the important identities that the teacher has covered in previous classes. Among the many problems that they are working on, the teacher writes the following one on the board:


$$
(x^4 + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x^8 + 1)(x^{16} + 1) = \cfrac{f(x)}{x - 1}
$$

She asks the learners to find the polynomial $f(x)$ and gives them two minutes to think about the problem. With no one coming up with any ideas, she writes down the solution, explaining the steps involved in the process:
<br><br>


$(1)$ First rearrange the binomials on the left in ascending order of power:

$$
   (x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^4 + 1)(x^8 + 1)(x^{16} + 1) = \cfrac{f(x)}{x - 1}
$$

<br><br>

$(2)$ Multiply both sides by $(x - 1)$:

$$
   (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^4 + 1)(x^8 + 1)(x^{16} + 1) = f(x)
$$

<br><br>

$(3)$ Make use of the identity $(a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2$ repeatedly to get:

$$
   (x^{32} - 1) = f(x)
$$



From the teacher's perspective, it is a job well done. She has written down a logically clear solution to the problem which her learners can now copy. If some of them fail to understand a step or two, she can always go over them again. Were this question to appear in an exam, she can be assured that her learners will write the solution without breaking a sweat. Her success is measured by the learner's success in clearing examinations. 

From the learner's perspective, it is one more question for which he knows the correct answer. Again, if this question comes up in an exam, he can write down the solution as lucidly as it was presented to him on the blackboard. If we push the envelope of idealism a bit further, we could expect the learner to appreciate the interesting pattern that forms the basis of this question.

## Expectation

Back to the pedagogical question with which we started, what are teachers expected to teach? From what happens in classrooms we could say that a mathematics teacher writes down the solutions to mathematical problems. If that sounds too mechanical and dry, we could say that she teaches learners how to solve problems in mathematics. Let us first see the process involved in solving a mathematical problem. There are at least two stages to it:

$(1)$ Insight



$(2)$ Computation



### Computation

The first few years of education trains the learner to become fluent in mathematical computation: basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of integers, manipulating fractions, solving simple equations and so on. Even post that a lot of what learners do can only be called exercises in computation. Any problem for which the procedure or algorithm is well known to the learner beforehand becomes an exercise in computation for him. He has to be a human-calculator for the duration of solving that problem. A simple example of such a problem is given below:

$$
\begin{align}
2x + 3y &= 10\\
7x - 4y &= 20
\end{align}
$$

We have to solve for $x, y$. I am not suggesting that this is a bad problem. On the contrary, if the learner is still unclear about the procedure for solving a system of linear equations in two variables, he must be made to solve as many problems as are necessary until he groks the algorithm. But once he has got the hang of it, every additional problem of the same type will only be a burden. The learner reaches a point where fluency in algorithmic procedures starts mattering less and less. The more problems that he is given which are modeled on problem-types that have been previously encountered, the more he becomes a human-calculator, and less a thinker.

### Insight

The soul of a problem is the insight that gave birth to it. Computation is merely the outer covering. We could turn to the game of basketball for an analogy. In performing a dunk, a player first needs to jump high enough so that his arms extend beyond the basket. The rest of the move is about bringing his arm down forcefully over the hoop. An insight is that jump or big leap from the ground while computation is about completing the dunk by bringing the ball down. In the problem that we just solved, there were two insights: the first was about rearranging the binomial terms in ascending order of degree, the second was to sense the possibility of using the identity $(a - b)(a + b)$ in the first place. All that remains is the job of computation where the learner repeatedly applies the identity to get the final answer.<br><br>

Now consider what happens when the teacher presents the insight without giving learners sufficient time to think about the problem. The learners are deprived of the opportunity to arrive at the insight. They don't have to think much, they just have to compute. This is akin to a coach lifting a young child learning basketball high enough so that he can put the ball through the hoop. While an innocent child may be grateful for the assistance provided, there will be no one around tomorrow to lift the child's future self. We have a paradox here. The job of the teacher is to teach problem-solving which involves two components: insight and computation. It has already  been established that mere computation is bound to get boring for the learners at some stage. But moment the teacher communicates the insight to her learners, the task of problem-solving reduces to one of computation. One way to get around this problem is for the teacher to assume the role of a writer of fiction. She cannot reveal the entire plot right away. She needs to gradually uncover it in stages. This is alright for problems that involve lot of insights. But when there is just one key insight, what could she do? <br><br>

## Teaching Insights


The paradox disappears if we reformulate the meaning of teaching for problem-solving. For that we need to look at insights more closely. Insights come in two types: original and borrowed. An original insight is a mathematical thought that the learner discovers while solving a problem without any external aid. It doesn't mean something that has never been thought by anyone before. That is not possible, especially in mathematics, and that too for such young minds. In all likelihood, the learner's solution to the problem will be just the same as the one given in the back of his textbook. Originality in this context is closer to a personal discovery that is only reliant on the learner's memory and intuition. Maybe he notices a connection to a problem that he solved many days back. Or he suddenly discovers some pattern that had eluded him an hour back. It becomes clear that an original insight cannot be communicated by the teacher. It is unfortunate that learners in our schools do computations on borrowed insights in the name of problem-solving.  <br><br>

The conclusion that we have to arrive at is that problem-solving cannot be taught. Problem-solving is about performing computations on top of original insights. It is another unfortunate fact that most learners finish their schooling by learning to become fluent in performing computations on borrowed insights. They have become good computers with unoriginal minds with the data copied from an external hard drive that we call a teacher. Why did things become like this? A lot of it has to do with examinations and standardized testing. Public exams are common to all learners. Conducting an exam on the same day across the country is no small feat which introduces some obvious constraints. Most of the questions will be drawn from a pre-specified pool of problem-templates. There will hardly be any questions that require original insight. A good human-computer would know the procedure to solve every problem in the exam. Standardized testing is convenient and reduces the burden on the teacher; she doesn't need to spend hours hunting for novel problems, and correcting answer scripts doesn't require much labor either. The benefits of the model are obvious and is therefore replicated across all years of schooling, from grade 1 to 12.



## Role of Teachers


Does this mean that teachers are useless and learners can do everything on their own. Of course not! Teachers have several important responsibilities: <br><br>

$(1)$ Organization and presentation of problems in the right sequence<br><br>

$(2)$ Customizing problems according to the needs of a learner <br><br>

$(3)$ Teaching strategies for problem-solving <br><br>

$(4)$ Moderating problem-solving sessions where learners silently work on problems individually <br><br>

$(5)$ Offering help when called for and pointing out errors and misconceptions <br><br>

$(6)$ Conducting discussion sessions with learners for solutions to difficult problems <br><br>


There could be several innovative methods here. Discussion sessions could be modeled after competitions held in mathematical gatherings in Russia, called mathematical circles, some of which are mentioned in the book Mathematical Circles, a Russian Experience. Let us say that a worksheet containing six problems with increasing levels of difficulty is distributed to learners. They have two days to solve the problems. After the stipulated time the teacher and learners meet to discuss the solutions. But instead of the teacher offering the solutions, the learners are asked to come to the board in pairs. One learner, called the challenger, can challenge the other to provide the answer to a question of his choice. The opponent can either accept the challenge or return it. Whichever learner accepts the challenge has to present her solution to the problem. The other learner can then examine the proposed solution, verifying its correctness and spotting flaws if there are any. If no errors are discovered the presenter wins, if not, her opponent wins. This will expose every solution to extreme levels of scrutiny, help develop a learner's capacity to spot errors in arguments, and refine logical arguments on the spot. The teacher could also take up the role of the challenger.<br><br>

Finally, time and failure are two of the greatest teachers. There can be no substitute for them. If a learner spends four hours sitting with a problem trying to figure out the solution, his perseverance should be encouraged and his failure should not be discouraged. Getting stuck is an unavoidable part of problem-solving. The sooner learners experience this the better prepared they are to face problems in the future. Mathematical problem-solving is about learning to think logically. It is not just about knowing the correct answer to questions. Learners should learn to think and reason clearly from a set of premises to reach a conclusion. Problem-solving is one of the many avenues that develop and perfect this capacity. If the correct answer is always going to be provided by a third person, how can the learner grow as an independent problem solver? More than anything else, where is the joy in always being provided with the answers by someone else? Learning to solve problems is pretty much like learning to play basketball or tennis. A tennis coach can demonstrate to a young learner how to hit the ball once or twice, how to bring the racket down in a smash, how to make use of the entire court, and correct the learner when he makes mistakes. But the learner cannot learn by simply watching the coach play. No matter how great a player his coach may be, if the learner nurtures any dreams of becoming a professional tennis player, he has to pick up the racket, get on the court and face his opponent, one ball at a time, one swing of the racket at a time.
