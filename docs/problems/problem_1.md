# AM-HM inequality

If $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers, prove that:
$$
\cfrac{a + b}{2} \geq \cfrac{2ab}{a + b}
$$

This is known as the AM-HM inequality. Also specify when equality occurs.

## Solution

- When dealing with simple inequalities, one of the first approaches is to compute the difference between the LHS and the RHS:

$$
\begin{align*}
\cfrac{a + b}{2} - \cfrac{2ab}{a + b} &= \cfrac{(a + b)^2 - 4ab}{2(a + b)}\\ \\
&= \cfrac{a^2 + b^2 + 2ab - 4ab}{2(a + b)}\\ \\
&= \cfrac{a^2 + b^2 - 2ab}{2(a + b)}\\ \\
&= \cfrac{(a - b)^2}{2(a + b)}\\ \\
&\geq 0
\end{align*}
$$

- This is because the numerator of the final fraction is a square and is always positive. As for the denominator, we have the sum of positive numbers which is positive. Equality occurs when $a = b$.

$$
\therefore\ \cfrac{a + b}{2} \geq \cfrac{2ab}{a + b}
$$
