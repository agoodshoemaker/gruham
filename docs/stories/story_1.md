# Wisdom Under an Umbrella

The sky is overcast. The clouds have decided that it is time to interrupt the test match between Australia and India. Test matches have become rare and one in Chennai is a blessing for the thousands of cricket fans that populate the city. Those who are witnessing the match at Chepauk would be throwing nervous glances at the skies after every over. When it rains, it is not just water that will go down the drains, but the price of a ticket and a good morning's entertainment.

I have never understood the point of seeing a test match live by going to the stadium. Star Sports does a great job of telecasting the live action. What with all the instant replays, expert analysis. And even at the venue, spectators invariably turn to the big screen to watch replays. Whenever I raise this observation in front of my friends, I get a standard response that watching a cricket match live is "an experience". That ends all arguments. Why is coffee at Caffe Coffee Day priced so high? You aren't just paying for the coffee but for the overall experience. I am yet to graduate from home-made filter coffee. Perhaps I never will.

I am waiting at a bus stop, a three kilometre walk from home. Busses screech to a halt well beyond the bus stand. I can almost sense them groaning. Imagine for a second that busses have the ability to read your thoughts. From the moment you enter till the time you leave, the bus records each thought that crosses your mind. Will any one of the records contain thoughts about the bus itself, the vehicle that transports you to office or school and back home every day? After all, busses also crave recognition. This is probably the reason they groan. It is not the load that makes them groan — they have been manufactured for that very purpose — but the ingratitude of passengers. I let my eyes linger on each vehicle that passes by. Autos stop once in a while, deliberately scanning the bus stand for potential sources of income.

Two hours have elapsed since I wrote the JEE. I knew right after exiting the examination hall that I would not be an IIT-ian. The world after high school offers two paths: one that leads us into an IIT, one that leads us elsewhere. Two hours after I joined the ranks of the non-IIT-ians, I am waiting at a bus stop, doing what is inevitable after an exam — post-mortem analysis. As to why I chose a bus stop, I have no clue. Maybe it is because a bus stand is one of the few places in Chennai where you are not reprimanded for not doing anything productive. You can always justify your position by stating that you are waiting for that elusive six o’clock bus that is always late by one hour.

Back to the post-mortem analysis. The funny thing about life is that we always ask the most important questions only during moments of crisis. We have been programmed for that. All of us are endowed with some level of curiosity but make sure that this curiosity-balloon is deflated by the time we become adults. After procrastinating for nearly two years, I asked myself the capital question — do I really want to do engineering? And when I mouthed this question aloud, I felt a wave of regret wash over me. I knew that I was late in asking this question. Answers can wait but questions must not. Questions are ever present to be asked. And then one by one, questions that I had been evading for a long time broke the roof of self-deception, tumbling out of the dark corners of my mind. Why did I enroll in a coaching class? Didn’t I know even then that I hated JEE preparation? Didn’t I long for those few minutes every night when I could paint something or read a book?

I felt as though every hour of preparation that I had painstakingly devoted to clear the JEE had been an utter waste of my resources. As I sat there at the bus stop, scanning the clouds for much needed solace, I noticed a familiar figure trudging along the sidewalk. With an umbrella to protect himself from the wrath of the rain gods, my father steadily approached the bus stand. I noticed an almost imperceptible limp and a silent struggle in his walk. He was panting when he reached me. He was not like this two years before. 

“How did you know that I would be here?”, I asked.

“You have come here three times in the past. All these visits were preceded by events that I believe were stressful to you. I guessed today was another such day”, my father replied.

“That is a good line of reasoning”.

“No. Not at all”, he said. “Contrarily, it is a very weak argument. That is precisely why I said that it was a guess. Remember the adage, correlation does not imply causation.”

And then he sat beside me, giving me solace that the clouds had denied. He was simply sitting there, looking at the people and busses that were passing by. Not a word was spoken. I have been in the presence of great orators and entertaining conversationalists. I have seen people floor me with their exuberance. I have seen knowledgeable men and women impress me with their erudition. But I have never seen anyone like my father comfort me with the sheer profundity of silence. One can be silent by being indifferent. One can be silent because of anger. But this was not mere silence, this was a display of camaraderie through the language of silence. Here was a person sitting by my side who was a friend more than a father.

“Appa”, I began, in a tremulous voice. “I failed.”

He continued to remain silent for a few more seconds.

“Do you mind if I talk to you for some time?”

I shook my head. Talking was very painful.

“I wouldn’t say bus stands offer the perfect setting for what I want to talk about, but we can remain here if it suits you. Just nod if you don’t mind going for a walk.”

I nodded.

“All right, then. Let us get going.”

Appa and I stepped out into the rain, the two of us huddled together under the protection of the umbrella. We walked till the end of the road and on Appa’s suggestion, stepped into a narrow lane. This was one of the many small streets that connect main roads in Chennai. I used to frequent this road when I was young. The silent and somewhat deserted lane has always attracted me.

“What I am going to say now may make sense to you, or it may sound like utter nonsense. But patiently hear me out. It may all sound too familiar, cliched. Sometimes cliches work, in fact most of the times they do. That is why they are popular. I will present to you my thoughts and leave them hanging there. Look at it as raw data, as information, take time to process it. If you feel that there is only junk- which is highly unlikely as there is something of value in everything - then feel free to send them to the trash. Are we fine on this point?”

I again nodded.

“Last week I read a wonderful quote by J.B.S Haldane, a British polymath who settled in India.” He whipped out his smartphone and with a soft sweeping motion unlocked the phone and began reading out, relishing every word he was speaking, giving each word the time it demanded to sink into the listener.

> I suppose the process of acceptance will pass through the usual four stages: i) This is worthless nonsense, ii) This is an interesting, but perverse, point of view, iii) This is true, but quite unimportant, iv) I always said so.

I read this and reread this. I have passed through the exact stages mentioned here countless times before. We all have a belief system to begin with. This system is a set of opinions, biases, prejudices, cherished ideas and to some extent our idiosyncrasies as well. We strongly hold that the contents of our belief system are immutable. Some of us acknowledge that there will be different belief systems for different people. Some fail to see that this is the case. What happens as we age? We see our belief systems crumble. This is quite natural. What I wanted to do 10 years back would seem childish to me now. I wanted to direct a movie when I was 20 years old. I had even applied to a film institute towards that end. And then suddenly it all vanished one day. Puff! I have always had a fascination for mathematics. Two years into engineering I thought of doing mathematics and dropped the idea then. I then thought of pursuing it after I got a job. The idea of quitting my job and doing mathematics fascinated me. And mind you I was fascinated by mathematics and mathematicians but not really passionate about doing mathematics. To that end, I made my life at office miserable. I tried to recollect all the negative experiences I had had at the workplace to provide enough justification to quit the job. We want to prove that we are right about something and marshall all the evidence we can find to justify our stand even if an overwhelming proportion of them convincingly prove otherwise. The human mind is very powerful in this regard. In the past I have been at the workplace hating every second of time spent there; and I have been at the very same building, sitting at the same desk, doing the same work, loving every second of it and wanting to do more. Wait, let me read out another quote, this one from the man who saw in a falling apple what generations of thinkers had failed to see.

> I was like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.

That is precisely the attitude one needs to have. Do you see what is striking about this quote? In it Newton states several important things. I would attach the following tags to this quote: curiosity, humility, beauty, progress. If interpreted in a very dry sense, Newton is stating that he knows that he doesn’t know much about the world we live in. This realization that there is so much out there that we don’t know and that, unlike Newton, we don’t acknowledge what we don’t know, struck me very late in life. The greats know their limitations, while the not-so-greats aka the common man deludes himself with half ripe knowledge. In this regard, there is another striking statement made by Sri Aurobindo, the great rishi of modern India, in the opening paragraph of his book Essays on the Gita. I love this sentence and would like you to read it. First let us find a place to sit. How about Annaji park?”

“That would be good”, I replied. Annaji park was a five minute walk from the small lane we were in. My bad mood had somewhat lifted, the receding clouds had probably played a role in my mood swings. It was still raining as we reached the park. But thankfully, there was a quiet place to sit with a roof over the top. Annaji park which is otherwise a very lively place looked deserted. Rain and the cricket match had driven parents and children home so that the park was left to the two of us.

I was beginning to get interested in what Appa was saying. He used to quote Sri Aurobindo very often. He no longer does that as presumably he sensed that none of us at home were really enthused about them. Books are his constant companions. I never really fancied reading any of those philosophical books. Each book is about 500 pages long and demands great concentration to read even a few pages. Something was different today. I was glad that Appa wanted me to read a passage from it.

He handed over the smartphone to me saying, “I seldom read from smartphones and other devices that try to take the place of my books. But there are utilities that such devices provide and it would be foolish to not take advantage of them. Read it out aloud if you don’t mind. Let me hear it from your mouth.”

> The World abounds with scriptures, sacred and profane, with revelations and half-revelations, with religions and philosophies, sects and schools and systems. To these the many minds of a half-ripe knowledge or no knowledge at all attach themselves with exclusiveness and passion and will have it that this or the other book alone is the eternal Word of God and all others are either impostures or at best imperfectly inspired, that this or that philosophy is the last word of the reasoning intellect and other systems are either errors or saved only by such partial truth in them as links them to the one true philosophical cult.

“Read it once more if you wish. Sri Aurobindo often compresses multiple ideas in a single line. Some of his lines can seem like entire paragraphs.”

After I had spent a sufficient time on the passage, Appa continued, “Though Sri Aurobindo is referring to scriptures in these lines, they have very great applicability to all fields of human endeavour. Look for instance at politics and the hundred ideologies and political organizations that we see around us, each guarding its opinion with a fierce intensity.”

Appa was quiet for sometime. I was trying to make sense of what he was saying. I was more cheerful now. Appa’s presence was having a positive effect on me. For the half hour that we had been out on the rainy streets, he had not uttered a word about JEE. He was reading out passages from the most unlikely sources in a casual, unhurried manner which had a calming effect. It was mildly drizzling. I suggested that we go for a walk around the park.

“Do you like rules?”, Appa asked, as we were into our second round.

“I don’t mind them.”

“Consider this statement: Shun extremes, embrace moderation.”

“That sounds cliche?”

Appa chuckled, “True. I am not denying that. But so what? Every fact of life, every great principle has already been uttered by great minds before us. Posterity must never forget that all generations prior to them have had an equal share of great men, of the same quality and character as we see around us today. Brilliant minds have roamed the Earth during its darkest hours. He who discovered the wheel is no less imaginative than the pioneers of the Internet revolution. In fact the cave dweller’s discoveries were more fundamental than the invention of the iPhone.”

The clouds were clearing. Two of us walking under an umbrella was not exactly a great experience, but I didn’t mind the minor discomfort. Appa didn’t seem to have any problems. Even if he did, he didn’t express it.

“Good old proverbs. If only man knew the art of application, the ability to act on great proverbs, the world would be a much better place. Life is short. There is no denying that. Which means, the one greatest resource that all of us have is time. You aren’t going to get it back. Never. You know why I am saying this.”

We had stopped walking now. Appa suggested that we sit for a while before going home.

“JEE is a tough examination."

I knew that this was coming.

"I know that", I said. Why did he have to bring it up now?

"Yes. But there are more challenging ones that life will throw at you. And none of this preparation will help. That is the beauty of it all. At that point we must be prepared to fail, to fall and not get dejected if it is steeper than the ones you have encountered before. So why was I talking about shunning extremes? It is simple. Avoid stressing yourself. Note that you must never miss the chance of exceeding yourself, of becoming better, as The Mother of Sri Aurobindo Ashram says. That is a love for progress which is altogether different from overexerting yourself. But to be obsessed about something, to the extent that your happiness hinges on the achievement or procurement of the object of obsession, is terrible. I don’t believe in raw passion. Those who mindlessly slog for JEE are in the end doing just that. How many of these kids really know what they are getting into? For them, the end matters. The means are never questioned. People say that you must do whatever it takes to reach the shore. That is ridiculous.”

“Take this from me: See the world around you. Remember that the means are as important as the ends, if not more. You must grow as an individual. That must be your aim. Medicine, engineering, law, journalism and the thousand and one streams that are out there are merely passing stages in your life. As you grow older, the world will start defining you by your vocation. Never submit to that. A vocation is a means. You are more than your job. You are more than the marks you score. The whole is always greater than the sum of the parts. Never forget this. You are an integral whole, a being with multiple identities and tendencies. Your true glory lies in harnessing all these powers, in giving each its due attention. Not a narrow specialization, but a broad perfection must be your aim. What happened to the painter in you? You used to play cricket. Where is the enthusiasm of the child that I used to see in you? Why should that childlike curiosity disappear as we age? Seriousness in life is important, but it must not be confused with extreme graveness. That large vision which sees life in one whole sweep is essential. Only that can save you. There can be bad days, bad weeks and bad months. But the sum total of your life will always be more glorious, filled with sunshine and laughter. It is in this mean-state that you should dwell. Above all I want you to rediscover yourself. Let Sri Aurobindo be your guide in this. These are his lovely words of advice. It looks as though he has specially crafted them for you:

“Every man has in him something divine, something his own, a chance of strength and perfection in however small a sphere, which God offers him to take or refuse. The task is to find it, develop it, use it.”

“Find it. Even if it takes a lifetime, find it.”

There was a long silence. Appa quietly sat beside me, one hand around on my shoulder, the other around the drenched umbrella, turning it in his hands in a slow repetitive manner. The intensity of his words were yet to sink in. I didn’t catch all of what he said. But I was satisfied with the emotions it evoked in me. That was all that mattered. The dark, depressing feelings that had occupied much of my day had disappeared. So did the clouds. It had stopped raining. The sun was out again. Back at Chepauk, Dravid and Laxman were putting their pads back on, ready to face Warne's flighted deliveries.

We slowly got up and made our way towards the gate. I looked back at the empty park and realised that I may never experience another moment like this in my life. There was a pang in my heart as I left the park with Appa. The last hour had been one of pure magic. We steadily made our way back home.

I hit the bell twice on reaching the doorstep.

“Where have the two of you been”, asked Amma, clearly angry at our uninformed absence.

“My son fancied a walk at this beautiful hour. I gave him company”, Appa said, smiling at me.

“Why were you silent on our way back”, I asked.

“There are moments in life when silence is of infinitely greater value than speech. I could feel that our walk back was one such moment for the two of us. Why would I spoilt that?”

And with that he disappeared into the bathroom with a towel in his hand while I rushed inside my room to find the paint brush that I had not touched in ages.
