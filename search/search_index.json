The manifestation of each capacity is like a musical note, a vibration. One of the possible aims of life is to discover these notes, tune them to perfection, and harmonize them. Beethoven perhaps had just one note within him, that of musical creation, but it was a supremely powerful note that has resonated through the ages. It was mathematical creation in the case of Ramanujan, and the patterns that he has left behind continue to remain a source of wonderment to mathematicians. Like in the case of Beethoven, this note of mathematical creation was perhaps the sole preoccupation of Ramanujan's life, but one of extreme beauty and richness. No two human destinies are alike. I believe most of us have within ourselves not just a solitary note, but a collection of notes, one or two of them being dominant and the rest quite significant but relatively smaller notes. A note has a distinct frequency, a mode of vibration. Taken in this sense, man is a bundle of vibrations. When he perfectly expresses one of these vibratory modes in an activity, he starts resonating with his inner being. This is what it means to be in a state of \u201cflow\u201d or \u201cto be in the zone\u201d. Such \u201cflow\u201d-moments are rare. What could be the reasons? One is that we are doing an activity that doesn\u2019t correspond to our principal modes of vibration. The other could be our wrong attitudes towards the work we do. It is not enough to find the right note, it is also important that we learn how to play it. Extending this argument, it is equally important to figure out how to harmonize the notes so as to produce a melody. The most common error is to turn a dominant note into the defining expression of our lives, ignoring every other note in our repertoire, and keep playing this note ad infinitum. A dull, monotonous life is the result. The other extreme is to jump between notes too frequently, not sounding the depths of any of them, producing a cacophony of discordant notes. This too is inimical to our growth. The initial period must be one of search, and the fruit of this search is the discovery of the principal modes that govern our being. The second period is one of organization, where we synthesize the various elements to produce a melody that becomes our true identity. The duration of the first phase is crucial. If it draws to a premature close, mostly because of insufficient exploration on our parts, then the second period becomes a mechanical organization of a set of activities that are not the expression of the capacities within us. Or the first period may never end, probably because we have overlooked our discovery of these principal modes of our being and continue to search in vain. This would mean that there is no organization in our life, it is a complete chaos, an interminable stream of random activities that succeed one after the other. There is no guarantee that we will succeed in this endeavor. But we have a pointer to guide us. These periods must not be exclusive of each other: there must be some organization in our lives as we search, and an element of search as we begin to organize various activities. If we are sincere in our search and do not let lower motives cloud our judgement, the divine will guide us closer and closer to the harmony that best expresses us.

N1: Definitions \u00b6 \\(M = \\{m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_n\\}\\) and \\(W = \\{w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n\\}\\) represent the set of men and women respectively. There are \\(n\\) men and an equal number of women: \\(|M| = |W| = n\\) . Matching A matching is a subset of \\(M \\times W\\) in which each man and woman appear at most one time in a pair. Perfect Matching A perfect matching is a matching in which each man and woman appear in exactly one pair. There is neither polygamy nor singlehood. The size of a perfect matching is \\(n\\) . Instability Let \\(S\\) be a perfect matching. \\((m, w)\\) and \\((m^{\\prime}, w^{\\prime})\\) are two pairs that belong to \\(S\\) . If \\(m\\) prefers \\(w^{\\prime}\\) to \\(w\\) and \\(w^{\\prime}\\) prefers \\(m\\) to \\(m^{\\prime}\\) , then \\((m, w^{\\prime})\\) is termed an instability with respect to \\(S\\) . Stable Matching A perfect matching \\(S\\) is stable if there is no instability with respect to it. Stable matchings are desirable as they are self-enforcing. In a stable matching no man will be able to abandon his current partner for some other woman higher up on his preference list. The same is true for women. A stable matching represents some sort of an equilibrium. Valid partner A woman \\(w\\) is a valid partner of a man \\(m\\) if \\((m, w)\\) is present in some stable matching. Best valid partner Let \\(w\\) be a valid partner of \\(m\\) . If \\(m\\) prefers \\(w\\) over every one of his valid partners, then \\(w\\) is said to be the best valid partner of \\(m\\) . Interesting questions: Can a perfect matching be assigned a potential energy? If that can be done, then a stable matching must be a configuration having the least potential energy. The preference lists of all women can be collated to give a score to each man. We could call this the desirability of each man. Likewise, we could compute a desirability score for each woman. What happens if we pair the most desirable man with the most desirable woman? Would that result in a stable matching? Tried this approach. This doesn't work. Though it seems like a good idea at first sight, this process ends up conflating the preference lists. Conflation causes confusion here. N2: Combinatorial aspects \u00b6 Some basic combinatorial results: The space of ordered pairs is represented by \\(M \\times W\\) . There are a total of \\(n^2\\) ordered pairs possible. Each ordered pair is of the form \\((m, w)\\) . The number of perfect matchings is \\(n!\\) There are \\(2n\\) preference lists, each of size \\(n\\) . \\((n!)^{2n}\\) is the size of the problem space. Each element in this space corresponds to one instantiation of the problem. Some interesting questions that have a combinatorial flavour: How many matchings are possible? Can we determine the number of stable matchings? What proportion of perfect matchings are stable? N3: Problem \u00b6 Given a set of arbitrary preferences, the following questions can be asked: Existence: Does a stable matching exist? Uniqueness: If it exists, is it unique? Construction: Is there an algorithm to construct a stable matching? Efficient construction: If there is an efficient algorithm to construct a stable matching? A stable matching is an object. An object is some abstract but well defined entity. Mathematics usually concerns itself with the first two points: existence and uniqueness of an object. Theoretical computer science is more interested in the last two points. An efficient algorithm in some sense is the crown of the whole thought process as it englobes all other stages in this process, with the exception of uniqueness. N4: Gale-Shapley algorithm \u00b6 The basic idea: All men and women are free to begin with. At any stage in the process, a man \\(m\\) could either be free or engaged. If \\(m\\) is free, then he can propose to a woman. \\(m\\) proposes to each woman at most once. This is expected behaviour. Naturally, he will propose to a woman highest in his preference list to whom he hasn't already proposed, say \\(w\\) . Now, \\(w\\) could either be free or engaged. If she is free, then \\((m, w)\\) get engaged. If \\(w\\) is engaged to some other man, say \\(m^{\\prime}\\) , we have two situations: if \\(w\\) prefers her current partner over \\(m\\) , then she will refuse the proposal from \\(m\\) if \\(w\\) prefers \\(m\\) to her current partner, then she will abandon \\(m^{\\prime}\\) and get engaged with \\(m\\) . Keep repeating the process until there are no free men. The core of the algorithm can be summarised in this sentence: In each iteration of the algorithm a free man proposes to a woman he hasn't already proposed to in the decreasing order of his preference list. Key features Once a woman is engaged, she always stays engaged. Men may enter and exit out of engagements. The sequence of partners for a man decreases. The sequence of partners for a woman increases. The number of free men is equal to the number of free women at the beginning and end of every step of the iteration. This equality is therefore an invariant. If a man is free, it implies that a woman is free. If a woman is free, it implies that no one has proposed to her yet. Termination In each step of the iteration, we are going exactly one step down the preference list of some man. So, after at most \\(n^{2}\\) iterations, we must have gone down the preference list of all \\(n\\) men. If at this stage, there is a free man, then it implies that there is also a free woman. But the free man would have proposed to this free woman at some stage. In which case, she can never be free. A contradiction that there can be a free man! So, the algorithm terminates and returns a perfect matching. Stable Matching Let \\((m, w)\\) and \\((m^{\\prime}, w^{\\prime})\\) be two pairs in a perfect matching \\(S\\) returned by the GS algorithm. Contrary to the result we have to prove, let us assume that \\((m, w^{\\prime})\\) constitutes an instability with respect to \\(S\\) . Since \\(m\\) prefers \\(w^{\\prime}\\) to \\(w\\) , he would have proposed to \\(w^{\\prime}\\) at some stage in the algorithm. Clearly, \\(w^{\\prime}\\) rejected him. However, she ends up with \\(m^{\\prime}\\) who is lower than \\(m\\) on her preference list. This cannot be and is a contradiction! Interesting questions: We can define a \"happiness score\" for each stable matching. For each man and woman, we ask them how happy they are with their current partner. This depends on the preference list of each person. We could assign a linear function over the preference list. Once the score is defined, we can average over all scores of the \\(2n\\) people. This represents the \"happiness score\" of a stable matching. What can we say about the \"happiness score\" of the matching returned by the GS algorithm? Does the GS algorithm maximize the happiness score? Can we think of algorithms that optimize for this happiness score? N5: Stable Matchings \u00b6 Consider the simple setup of \\(n = 2\\) : \\[ \\begin{align} M &= \\{m_1, m_2\\}\\\\ W &= \\{w_1, w_2\\} \\end{align} \\] Configuration-1 \\[ \\begin{align} m_1 &: [w_1, w_2]\\\\ m_2 &: [w_2, w_1]\\\\ w_1 &: [m_1, m_2]\\\\w_2 &: [m_2, m_1]\\end{align} \\] There is only one stable matching here: \\(\\{(m_1, w_1), (m_2, w_2)\\}\\) Note how the preferences of the men mesh perfectly with each other. Likewise, the preferences of the women mesh perfectly with each other. This harmony is there across the two genders as well. This represents an ideal world in which everyone is happy as one could possibly be. Configuration-2 \\[ \\begin{align} m_1 &: [w_1, w_2]\\\\ m_2 &: [w_2, w_1]\\\\ w_1 &: [m_2, m_1]\\\\w_2 &: [m_1, m_2]\\end{align} \\] \\(\\{(m_1, w_1), (m_2, w_2)\\}\\) is a stable matching. Here, the preferences of men mesh perfectly with each other, that of women also are in harmony. But, there is no harmony across the genders. So, while the men are perfectly happy, the women are miserable. \\(\\{(m_1, w_2), (m_2, w_1)\\}\\) is another stable matching. Here, women are happy and men are miserable. This configuration shows that stable matchings are not unique. Not just that, there is an asymmetry in the kind of matchings that we obtain. This represents a divided world in which one group is happy and the other group is miserable. Configuration-3 \\[ \\begin{align} m_1 &: [w_1, w_2]\\\\ m_2 &: [w_1, w_2]\\\\ w_1 &: [m_2, m_1]\\\\w_2 &: [m_2, m_1]\\end{align} \\] \\(\\{(m_1, w_1), (m_2, w_2)\\}\\) is not a stable matching as \\((m_2, w_1)\\) is an instability. \\(\\{(m_1, w_2), (m_2, w_1)\\}\\) has to be a stable matching. This is an interesting matching. There is perfect compatibility as far as one pair is concerned, and total incompatibility in case of the other pair. This represents a more complex world in which some pairs are happy and others are miserable. But at the level of the group, the outcome is somewhat the same. Interesting configurations What happens to a configuration in which a man is at the bottom of the preference list of every woman? What happens if the preference list of all men are identical? N6: Consistency \u00b6 For a given configuration, the stable matching returned by the GS algorithm is always the same and is given by: \\[ S^{*} = \\{(m, best(m))\\ |\\ m \\in M\\} \\] where \\(best(m)\\) is the best valid partner of \\(m\\) . Interesting questions: Is this even a matching? Two men could have the same best valid partner. Is this a perfect matching? Is this a stable matching? The basic idea is to posit a stable matching returned by GS where a man \\(m\\) has been rejected by his best a valid partnter. Let us proceed with this idea. Assume that \\(S\\) is a stable matching returned by GS in which a man \\(m\\) is rejected by one of his valid partners, say \\(w\\) , for the very first time in the execution of the algorithm. Since men propose in the decreasing order of preferences, \\(w\\) has to be the best valid partner of \\(m\\) . Now we focus on this rejection. What happened when \\(w\\) rejected \\(m\\) ? One of these two things could have happened: \\(w\\) was already engaged to a man \\(m^{\\prime}\\) whom she prefers to \\(m\\) . \\(w\\) was engaged to \\(m\\) , but a new proposal from a man \\(m^{\\prime}\\) whom she prefers to \\(m\\) made her abandon \\(m\\) In either case, we see that \\(w\\) prefers \\(m^{\\prime}\\) over \\(m\\) . Now, there is a stable matching \\(S^{\\prime}\\) in which \\((m, w)\\) is a pair. This is because \\(w\\) is a valid (best) partner of \\(m\\) . In this matching, who is \\(m^{\\prime}\\) paired with? Let us say that it is a woman \\(w^{\\prime}\\) . Clearly, \\(w^{\\prime}\\) is a valid partner of \\(m^{\\prime}\\) . Now, \\(m^{\\prime}\\) prefers \\(w\\) over \\(w^{\\prime}\\) . If not, then in our algorithm, \\(m^{\\prime}\\) would have rejected \\(w^{\\prime}\\) , one of his valid partners, before getting engaged to \\(w\\) . But this cannot be as we have assumed that \\(w\\) is the first woman to reject a valid partner. We now have the following preferences: \\(w\\) prefers \\(m^{\\prime}\\) over \\(m\\) \\(m^{\\prime}\\) prefers \\(w\\) over \\(w^{\\prime}\\) In the stable matching \\(S^{\\prime}\\) , we have the pairs \\((m, w)\\) and \\((m^{\\prime}, w^{\\prime})\\) . With respect to \\(S^{\\prime}\\) , \\((m^{\\prime}, w)\\) constitutes an instability. And that contradicts our initial claim. N7: Asymmetry and philosophical implications \u00b6 The asymmetry in the GS algorithm is that the side that does the proposing ends up with the best outcomes and the side that accepts and evaluates the proposals ends up with the worst possible outcomes, with the terms best and worst understood in a precise sense. Let us call the side that proposes the active side and the side that accepts proposals the passive side. We see that the active side is better off than the passive side. Notice that it appears as though the passive side is actually better off. As the algorithm progresses, passive participants seem to be in a superior state. What gives this impression? The active participants come to the passive folks with proposals, the passive participants seem to have the power of rejection. The active participants can only propose and hope for the best. It appears as though they don't have any agency and power in the process. So, how is it that the passive side is worse off in the end? The power of rejection is an illusion or is a misreading. The passive participants do not reject intelligently, they reject on principle, myopically. They suffer from what is nowadays called FOMO: fear of missing out. This is again the reason why the accept the first proposal that comes their way. On top of this, the passive participants lack initiative. The other problem with the passive participants is that they are opportunistic. The moment a better proposal comes, they abandon the current engagement. So, the passive groups can be characterized as: myopic opportunistic The active participants on the other hand are: loyal enterprising This characterisation of the two groups is an emergent property of the algorithm. The algorithm's design is responsible for this characterisation. A natural question then is, can we invert this process? That is, can we design an algorithm that will conform to an a priori characterisation of the groups. So, what if we want an algorithm in which both groups are enterprising? Can we design an algorithm in which the emergent property is in line with this seed idea? N8: Other ideas \u00b6 Can we randomly pair each man to a woman and then keep looking for instabilities and remove them one by one? Will this result in a stable matching? Surprisingly, this does seem to work! A simple random pairing is as follows: \\(S = \\{(m_i, w_i)\\ |\\ 1 \\leq i \\leq n\\}\\) A simple nested loop goes over all pairs of pairs and checks for an instability. If there is one, it removes it. This keeps happening until the matching stabilises. What is interesting is: GS and this randomised algorithm return the same stable matching several times for small values of \\(n\\) There are cases when this algorithm returns a different stable matching. It is obviously inefficient as it is currently implemented. There are cases when algorithm goes into an infinite loop. Is it some kind of a local optimum? The number of iterations before it stabilises is huge. For example, when \\(n = 20\\) , it is \\(80\\) in one case and \\(20000\\) in another. This question has already been resolved in the paper by Roth and Vate: Random Paths to Stability in Two-Sided Matching.

The preference lists of all women can be collated to give a score to each man. We could call this the desirability of each man. Likewise, we could compute a desirability score for each woman. What happens if we pair the most desirable man with the most desirable woman? Would that result in a stable matching? Tried this approach. This doesn't work. Though it seems like a good idea at first sight, this process ends up conflating the preference lists.

Theoretical computer science is more interested in the last two points. An efficient algorithm in some sense is the crown of the whole thought process as it englobes all other stages in this process, with the exception of uniqueness.","title":"N3: Problem"},{"location":"ideas/algorithms/smp/#n4-gale-shapley-algorithm","text":"The basic idea: All men and women are free to begin with. At any stage in the process, a man \\(m\\) could either be free or engaged. If \\(m\\) is free, then he can propose to a woman. \\(m\\) proposes to each woman at most once. This is expected behaviour. Naturally, he will propose to a woman highest in his preference list to whom he hasn't already proposed, say \\(w\\) . Now, \\(w\\) could either be free or engaged. If she is free, then \\((m, w)\\) get engaged. If \\(w\\) is engaged to some other man, say \\(m^{\\prime}\\) , we have two situations: if \\(w\\) prefers her current partner over \\(m\\) , then she will refuse the proposal from \\(m\\) if \\(w\\) prefers \\(m\\) to her current partner, then she will abandon \\(m^{\\prime}\\) and get engaged with \\(m\\) . Keep repeating the process until there are no free men. The core of the algorithm can be summarised in this sentence: In each iteration of the algorithm a free man proposes to a woman he hasn't already proposed to in the decreasing order of his preference list. Key features Once a woman is engaged, she always stays engaged. Men may enter and exit out of engagements. The sequence of partners for a man decreases. The sequence of partners for a woman increases. The number of free men is equal to the number of free women at the beginning and end of every step of the iteration. This equality is therefore an invariant. If a man is free, it implies that a woman is free. If a woman is free, it implies that no one has proposed to her yet. Termination In each step of the iteration, we are going exactly one step down the preference list of some man. So, after at most \\(n^{2}\\) iterations, we must have gone down the preference list of all \\(n\\) men. If at this stage, there is a free man, then it implies that there is also a free woman. But the free man would have proposed to this free woman at some stage. In which case, she can never be free. A contradiction that there can be a free man! So, the algorithm terminates and returns a perfect matching. Stable Matching Let \\((m, w)\\) and \\((m^{\\prime}, w^{\\prime})\\) be two pairs in a perfect matching \\(S\\) returned by the GS algorithm. Contrary to the result we have to prove, let us assume that \\((m, w^{\\prime})\\) constitutes an instability with respect to \\(S\\) . Since \\(m\\) prefers \\(w^{\\prime}\\) to \\(w\\) , he would have proposed to \\(w^{\\prime}\\) at some stage in the algorithm. Clearly, \\(w^{\\prime}\\) rejected him. However, she ends up with \\(m^{\\prime}\\) who is lower than \\(m\\) on her preference list. This cannot be and is a contradiction! Interesting questions: We can define a \"happiness score\" for each stable matching. For each man and woman, we ask them how happy they are with their current partner. This depends on the preference list of each person. We could assign a linear function over the preference list. Once the score is defined, we can average over all scores of the \\(2n\\) people. This represents the \"happiness score\" of a stable matching. What can we say about the \"happiness score\" of the matching returned by the GS algorithm? Does the GS algorithm maximize the happiness score? Can we think of algorithms that optimize for this happiness score?","title":"N4: Gale-Shapley algorithm"},{"location":"ideas/algorithms/smp/#n5-stable-matchings","text":"Consider the simple setup of \\(n = 2\\) : \\[ \\begin{align} M &= \\{m_1, m_2\\}\\\\ W &= \\{w_1, w_2\\} \\end{align} \\] Configuration-1 \\[ \\begin{align} m_1 &: [w_1, w_2]\\\\ m_2 &: [w_2, w_1]\\\\ w_1 &: [m_1, m_2]\\\\w_2 &: [m_2, m_1]\\end{align} \\] There is only one stable matching here: \\(\\{(m_1, w_1), (m_2, w_2)\\}\\) Note how the preferences of the men mesh perfectly with each other.

Interesting configurations What happens to a configuration in which a man is at the bottom of the preference list of every woman?

Interesting questions: Is this even a matching? Two men could have the same best valid partner. Is this a perfect matching? Is this a stable matching? The basic idea is to posit a stable matching returned by GS where a man \\(m\\) has been rejected by his best a valid partnter. Let us proceed with this idea. Assume that \\(S\\) is a stable matching returned by GS in which a man \\(m\\) is rejected by one of his valid partners, say \\(w\\) , for the very first time in the execution of the algorithm. Since men propose in the decreasing order of preferences, \\(w\\) has to be the best valid partner of \\(m\\) . Now we focus on this rejection. What happened when \\(w\\) rejected \\(m\\) ? One of these two things could have happened: \\(w\\) was already engaged to a man \\(m^{\\prime}\\) whom she prefers to \\(m\\) . \\(w\\) was engaged to \\(m\\) , but a new proposal from a man \\(m^{\\prime}\\) whom she prefers to \\(m\\) made her abandon \\(m\\) In either case, we see that \\(w\\) prefers \\(m^{\\prime}\\) over \\(m\\) . Now, there is a stable matching \\(S^{\\prime}\\) in which \\((m, w)\\) is a pair. This is because \\(w\\) is a valid (best) partner of \\(m\\) . In this matching, who is \\(m^{\\prime}\\) paired with? Let us say that it is a woman \\(w^{\\prime}\\) . Clearly, \\(w^{\\prime}\\) is a valid partner of \\(m^{\\prime}\\) . Now, \\(m^{\\prime}\\) prefers \\(w\\) over \\(w^{\\prime}\\) . If not, then in our algorithm, \\(m^{\\prime}\\) would have rejected \\(w^{\\prime}\\) , one of his valid partners, before getting engaged to \\(w\\) . But this cannot be as we have assumed that \\(w\\) is the first woman to reject a valid partner. We now have the following preferences: \\(w\\) prefers \\(m^{\\prime}\\) over \\(m\\) \\(m^{\\prime}\\) prefers \\(w\\) over \\(w^{\\prime}\\) In the stable matching \\(S^{\\prime}\\) , we have the pairs \\((m, w)\\) and \\((m^{\\prime}, w^{\\prime})\\) . With respect to \\(S^{\\prime}\\) , \\((m^{\\prime}, w)\\) constitutes an instability. And that contradicts our initial claim.","title":"N6: Consistency"},{"location":"ideas/algorithms/smp/#n7-asymmetry-and-philosophical-implications","text":"The asymmetry in the GS algorithm is that the side that does the proposing ends up with the best outcomes and the side that accepts and evaluates the proposals ends up with the worst possible outcomes, with the terms best and worst understood in a precise sense. Let us call the side that proposes the active side and the side that accepts proposals the passive side. We see that the active side is better off than the passive side. Notice that it appears as though the passive side is actually better off. As the algorithm progresses, passive participants seem to be in a superior state. What gives this impression? The active participants come to the passive folks with proposals, the passive participants seem to have the power of rejection. The active participants can only propose and hope for the best. It appears as though they don't have any agency and power in the process. So, how is it that the passive side is worse off in the end? The power of rejection is an illusion or is a misreading. The passive participants do not reject intelligently, they reject on principle, myopically. They suffer from what is nowadays called FOMO: fear of missing out. This is again the reason why the accept the first proposal that comes their way. On top of this, the passive participants lack initiative. The other problem with the passive participants is that they are opportunistic. The moment a better proposal comes, they abandon the current engagement. So, the passive groups can be characterized as: myopic opportunistic The active participants on the other hand are: loyal enterprising This characterisation of the two groups is an emergent property of the algorithm. The algorithm's design is responsible for this characterisation. A natural question then is, can we invert this process? That is, can we design an algorithm that will conform to an a priori characterisation of the groups. So, what if we want an algorithm in which both groups are enterprising?

If the word discussing sounds too far-fetched, please correct it to something less democratic. The learners are familiar with most of the important identities that the teacher has covered in previous classes. Among the many problems that they are working on, the teacher writes the following one on the board: \\[ (x^4 + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x^8 + 1)(x^{16} + 1) = \\cfrac{f(x)}{x - 1} \\] She asks the learners to find the polynomial \\(f(x)\\) and gives them two minutes to think about the problem.

She has written down a logically clear solution to the problem which her learners can now copy. If some of them fail to understand a step or two, she can always go over them again. Were this question to appear in an exam, she can be assured that her learners will write the solution without breaking a sweat. Her success is measured by the learner's success in clearing examinations. From the learner's perspective, it is one more question for which he knows the correct answer. Again, if this question comes up in an exam, he can write down the solution as lucidly as it was presented to him on the blackboard. If we push the envelope of idealism a bit further, we could expect the learner to appreciate the interesting pattern that forms the basis of this question. Expectation \u00b6 Back to the pedagogical question with which we started, what are teachers expected to teach? From what happens in classrooms we could say that a mathematics teacher writes down the solutions to mathematical problems. If that sounds too mechanical and dry, we could say that she teaches learners how to solve problems in mathematics. Let us first see the process involved in solving a mathematical problem. There are at least two stages to it: \\((1)\\) Insight \\((2)\\) Computation Computation \u00b6 The first few years of education trains the learner to become fluent in mathematical computation: basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of integers, manipulating fractions, solving simple equations and so on. Even post that a lot of what learners do can only be called exercises in computation. Any problem for which the procedure or algorithm is well known to the learner beforehand becomes an exercise in computation for him. He has to be a human-calculator for the duration of solving that problem. A simple example of such a problem is given below: \\[ \\begin{align} 2x + 3y &= 10\\\\ 7x - 4y &= 20 \\end{align} \\] We have to solve for \\(x, y\\) . I am not suggesting that this is a bad problem. On the contrary, if the learner is still unclear about the procedure for solving a system of linear equations in two variables, he must be made to solve as many problems as are necessary until he groks the algorithm. But once he has got the hang of it, every additional problem of the same type will only be a burden. The learner reaches a point where fluency in algorithmic procedures starts mattering less and less. The more problems that he is given which are modeled on problem-types that have been previously encountered, the more he becomes a human-calculator, and less a thinker. Insight \u00b6 The soul of a problem is the insight that gave birth to it. Computation is merely the outer covering. We could turn to the game of basketball for an analogy. In performing a dunk, a player first needs to jump high enough so that his arms extend beyond the basket. The rest of the move is about bringing his arm down forcefully over the hoop. An insight is that jump or big leap from the ground while computation is about completing the dunk by bringing the ball down. In the problem that we just solved, there were two insights: the first was about rearranging the binomial terms in ascending order of degree, the second was to sense the possibility of using the identity \\((a - b)(a + b)\\) in the first place. All that remains is the job of computation where the learner repeatedly applies the identity to get the final answer. Now consider what happens when the teacher presents the insight without giving learners sufficient time to think about the problem. The learners are deprived of the opportunity to arrive at the insight. They don't have to think much, they just have to compute. This is akin to a coach lifting a young child learning basketball high enough so that he can put the ball through the hoop. While an innocent child may be grateful for the assistance provided, there will be no one around tomorrow to lift the child's future self. We have a paradox here. The job of the teacher is to teach problem-solving which involves two components: insight and computation. It has already been established that mere computation is bound to get boring for the learners at some stage. But moment the teacher communicates the insight to her learners, the task of problem-solving reduces to one of computation. One way to get around this problem is for the teacher to assume the role of a writer of fiction. She cannot reveal the entire plot right away. She needs to gradually uncover it in stages. This is alright for problems that involve lot of insights. But when there is just one key insight, what could she do? Teaching Insights \u00b6 The paradox disappears if we reformulate the meaning of teaching for problem-solving. For that we need to look at insights more closely. Insights come in two types: original and borrowed. An original insight is a mathematical thought that the learner discovers while solving a problem without any external aid. It doesn't mean something that has never been thought by anyone before. That is not possible, especially in mathematics, and that too for such young minds. In all likelihood, the learner's solution to the problem will be just the same as the one given in the back of his textbook. Originality in this context is closer to a personal discovery that is only reliant on the learner's memory and intuition. Maybe he notices a connection to a problem that he solved many days back. Or he suddenly discovers some pattern that had eluded him an hour back. It becomes clear that an original insight cannot be communicated by the teacher. It is unfortunate that learners in our schools do computations on borrowed insights in the name of problem-solving. The conclusion that we have to arrive at is that problem-solving cannot be taught. Problem-solving is about performing computations on top of original insights. It is another unfortunate fact that most learners finish their schooling by learning to become fluent in performing computations on borrowed insights. They have become good computers with unoriginal minds with the data copied from an external hard drive that we call a teacher. Why did things become like this? A lot of it has to do with examinations and standardized testing. Public exams are common to all learners. Conducting an exam on the same day across the country is no small feat which introduces some obvious constraints. Most of the questions will be drawn from a pre-specified pool of problem-templates. There will hardly be any questions that require original insight. A good human-computer would know the procedure to solve every problem in the exam. Standardized testing is convenient and reduces the burden on the teacher; she doesn't need to spend hours hunting for novel problems, and correcting answer scripts doesn't require much labor either. The benefits of the model are obvious and is therefore replicated across all years of schooling, from grade 1 to 12. Role of Teachers \u00b6 Does this mean that teachers are useless and learners can do everything on their own. Of course not! Teachers have several important responsibilities: \\((1)\\) Organization and presentation of problems in the right sequence \\((2)\\) Customizing problems according to the needs of a learner \\((3)\\) Teaching strategies for problem-solving \\((4)\\) Moderating problem-solving sessions where learners silently work on problems individually \\((5)\\) Offering help when called for and pointing out errors and misconceptions \\((6)\\) Conducting discussion sessions with learners for solutions to difficult problems There could be several innovative methods here. Discussion sessions could be modeled after competitions held in mathematical gatherings in Russia, called mathematical circles, some of which are mentioned in the book Mathematical Circles, a Russian Experience. Let us say that a worksheet containing six problems with increasing levels of difficulty is distributed to learners. They have two days to solve the problems. After the stipulated time the teacher and learners meet to discuss the solutions. But instead of the teacher offering the solutions, the learners are asked to come to the board in pairs. One learner, called the challenger, can challenge the other to provide the answer to a question of his choice. The opponent can either accept the challenge or return it. Whichever learner accepts the challenge has to present her solution to the problem. The other learner can then examine the proposed solution, verifying its correctness and spotting flaws if there are any. If no errors are discovered the presenter wins, if not, her opponent wins. This will expose every solution to extreme levels of scrutiny, help develop a learner's capacity to spot errors in arguments, and refine logical arguments on the spot. The teacher could also take up the role of the challenger. Finally, time and failure are two of the greatest teachers. There can be no substitute for them. If a learner spends four hours sitting with a problem trying to figure out the solution, his perseverance should be encouraged and his failure should not be discouraged. Getting stuck is an unavoidable part of problem-solving. The sooner learners experience this the better prepared they are to face problems in the future. Mathematical problem-solving is about learning to think logically. It is not just about knowing the correct answer to questions. Learners should learn to think and reason clearly from a set of premises to reach a conclusion. Problem-solving is one of the many avenues that develop and perfect this capacity. If the correct answer is always going to be provided by a third person, how can the learner grow as an independent problem solver? More than anything else, where is the joy in always being provided with the answers by someone else? Learning to solve problems is pretty much like learning to play basketball or tennis. A tennis coach can demonstrate to a young learner how to hit the ball once or twice, how to bring the racket down in a smash, how to make use of the entire court, and correct the learner when he makes mistakes. But the learner cannot learn by simply watching the coach play. No matter how great a player his coach may be, if the learner nurtures any dreams of becoming a professional tennis player, he has to pick up the racket, get on the court and face his opponent, one ball at a time, one swing of the racket at a time.","title":"The Pedagogy of Problem-solving"},{"location":"ideas/mathematics_education/problem_solving/#the-pedagogy-of-problem-solving","text":"","title":"The Pedagogy of Problem-solving"},{"location":"ideas/mathematics_education/problem_solving/#status-quo","text":"If problem-solving is the centerpiece of mathematics education at schools, what are teachers expected to teach?

The more problems that he is given which are modeled on problem-types that have been previously encountered, the more he becomes a human-calculator, and less a thinker.","title":"Computation"},{"location":"ideas/mathematics_education/problem_solving/#insight","text":"The soul of a problem is the insight that gave birth to it. Computation is merely the outer covering. We could turn to the game of basketball for an analogy. In performing a dunk, a player first needs to jump high enough so that his arms extend beyond the basket. The rest of the move is about bringing his arm down forcefully over the hoop. An insight is that jump or big leap from the ground while computation is about completing the dunk by bringing the ball down. In the problem that we just solved, there were two insights: the first was about rearranging the binomial terms in ascending order of degree, the second was to sense the possibility of using the identity \\((a - b)(a + b)\\) in the first place. All that remains is the job of computation where the learner repeatedly applies the identity to get the final answer. Now consider what happens when the teacher presents the insight without giving learners sufficient time to think about the problem. The learners are deprived of the opportunity to arrive at the insight. They don't have to think much, they just have to compute. This is akin to a coach lifting a young child learning basketball high enough so that he can put the ball through the hoop. While an innocent child may be grateful for the assistance provided, there will be no one around tomorrow to lift the child's future self. We have a paradox here. The job of the teacher is to teach problem-solving which involves two components: insight and computation. It has already been established that mere computation is bound to get boring for the learners at some stage. But moment the teacher communicates the insight to her learners, the task of problem-solving reduces to one of computation. One way to get around this problem is for the teacher to assume the role of a writer of fiction. She cannot reveal the entire plot right away. She needs to gradually uncover it in stages. This is alright for problems that involve lot of insights. But when there is just one key insight, what could she do?","title":"Insight"},{"location":"ideas/mathematics_education/problem_solving/#teaching-insights","text":"The paradox disappears if we reformulate the meaning of teaching for problem-solving. For that we need to look at insights more closely. Insights come in two types: original and borrowed. An original insight is a mathematical thought that the learner discovers while solving a problem without any external aid. It doesn't mean something that has never been thought by anyone before. That is not possible, especially in mathematics, and that too for such young minds. In all likelihood, the learner's solution to the problem will be just the same as the one given in the back of his textbook. Originality in this context is closer to a personal discovery that is only reliant on the learner's memory and intuition. Maybe he notices a connection to a problem that he solved many days back. Or he suddenly discovers some pattern that had eluded him an hour back. It becomes clear that an original insight cannot be communicated by the teacher. It is unfortunate that learners in our schools do computations on borrowed insights in the name of problem-solving. The conclusion that we have to arrive at is that problem-solving cannot be taught. Problem-solving is about performing computations on top of original insights. It is another unfortunate fact that most learners finish their schooling by learning to become fluent in performing computations on borrowed insights. They have become good computers with unoriginal minds with the data copied from an external hard drive that we call a teacher. Why did things become like this? A lot of it has to do with examinations and standardized testing. Public exams are common to all learners. Conducting an exam on the same day across the country is no small feat which introduces some obvious constraints. Most of the questions will be drawn from a pre-specified pool of problem-templates. There will hardly be any questions that require original insight. A good human-computer would know the procedure to solve every problem in the exam. Standardized testing is convenient and reduces the burden on the teacher; she doesn't need to spend hours hunting for novel problems, and correcting answer scripts doesn't require much labor either. The benefits of the model are obvious and is therefore replicated across all years of schooling, from grade 1 to 12.","title":"Teaching Insights"},{"location":"ideas/mathematics_education/problem_solving/#role-of-teachers","text":"Does this mean that teachers are useless and learners can do everything on their own. Of course not! Teachers have several important responsibilities: \\((1)\\) Organization and presentation of problems in the right sequence \\((2)\\) Customizing problems according to the needs of a learner \\((3)\\) Teaching strategies for problem-solving \\((4)\\) Moderating problem-solving sessions where learners silently work on problems individually \\((5)\\) Offering help when called for and pointing out errors and misconceptions \\((6)\\) Conducting discussion sessions with learners for solutions to difficult problems There could be several innovative methods here. Discussion sessions could be modeled after competitions held in mathematical gatherings in Russia, called mathematical circles, some of which are mentioned in the book Mathematical Circles, a Russian Experience. Let us say that a worksheet containing six problems with increasing levels of difficulty is distributed to learners. They have two days to solve the problems. After the stipulated time the teacher and learners meet to discuss the solutions. But instead of the teacher offering the solutions, the learners are asked to come to the board in pairs. One learner, called the challenger, can challenge the other to provide the answer to a question of his choice. The opponent can either accept the challenge or return it. Whichever learner accepts the challenge has to present her solution to the problem. The other learner can then examine the proposed solution, verifying its correctness and spotting flaws if there are any. If no errors are discovered the presenter wins, if not, her opponent wins. This will expose every solution to extreme levels of scrutiny, help develop a learner's capacity to spot errors in arguments, and refine logical arguments on the spot. The teacher could also take up the role of the challenger. Finally, time and failure are two of the greatest teachers. There can be no substitute for them. If a learner spends four hours sitting with a problem trying to figure out the solution, his perseverance should be encouraged and his failure should not be discouraged. Getting stuck is an unavoidable part of problem-solving. The sooner learners experience this the better prepared they are to face problems in the future. Mathematical problem-solving is about learning to think logically. It is not just about knowing the correct answer to questions. Learners should learn to think and reason clearly from a set of premises to reach a conclusion. Problem-solving is one of the many avenues that develop and perfect this capacity. If the correct answer is always going to be provided by a third person, how can the learner grow as an independent problem solver? More than anything else, where is the joy in always being provided with the answers by someone else? Learning to solve problems is pretty much like learning to play basketball or tennis. A tennis coach can demonstrate to a young learner how to hit the ball once or twice, how to bring the racket down in a smash, how to make use of the entire court, and correct the learner when he makes mistakes. But the learner cannot learn by simply watching the coach play. No matter how great a player his coach may be, if the learner nurtures any dreams of becoming a professional tennis player, he has to pick up the racket, get on the court and face his opponent, one ball at a time, one swing of the racket at a time.","title":"Role of Teachers"},{"location":"ideas/mathematics_education/using_wikipedia/","text":"Using Wikipedia \u00b6 While Wikipedia is an excellent reference for anything you would like to know about, it is not a good source to learn something from scratch or to learn it deeply.

The clouds have decided that it is time to interrupt the test match between Australia and India. Test matches have become rare and one in Chennai is a blessing for the thousands of cricket fans that populate the city. Those who are witnessing the match at Chepauk would be throwing nervous glances at the skies after every over. When it rains, it is not just water that will go down the drains, but the price of a ticket and a good morning's entertainment. I have never understood the point of seeing a test match live by going to the stadium. Star Sports does a great job of telecasting the live action. What with all the instant replays, expert analysis. And even at the venue, spectators invariably turn to the big screen to watch replays. Whenever I raise this observation in front of my friends, I get a standard response that watching a cricket match live is \"an experience\". That ends all arguments. Why is coffee at Caffe Coffee Day priced so high? You aren't just paying for the coffee but for the overall experience. I am yet to graduate from home-made filter coffee. Perhaps I never will. I am waiting at a bus stop, a three kilometre walk from home. Busses screech to a halt well beyond the bus stand. I can almost sense them groaning. Imagine for a second that busses have the ability to read your thoughts. From the moment you enter till the time you leave, the bus records each thought that crosses your mind. Will any one of the records contain thoughts about the bus itself, the vehicle that transports you to office or school and back home every day? After all, busses also crave recognition. This is probably the reason they groan. It is not the load that makes them groan \u2014 they have been manufactured for that very purpose \u2014 but the ingratitude of passengers. I let my eyes linger on each vehicle that passes by. Autos stop once in a while, deliberately scanning the bus stand for potential sources of income. Two hours have elapsed since I wrote the JEE. I knew right after exiting the examination hall that I would not be an IIT-ian. The world after high school offers two paths: one that leads us into an IIT, one that leads us elsewhere. Two hours after I joined the ranks of the non-IIT-ians, I am waiting at a bus stop, doing what is inevitable after an exam \u2014 post-mortem analysis. As to why I chose a bus stop, I have no clue. Maybe it is because a bus stand is one of the few places in Chennai where you are not reprimanded for not doing anything productive. You can always justify your position by stating that you are waiting for that elusive six o\u2019clock bus that is always late by one hour. Back to the post-mortem analysis. The funny thing about life is that we always ask the most important questions only during moments of crisis. We have been programmed for that. All of us are endowed with some level of curiosity but make sure that this curiosity-balloon is deflated by the time we become adults. After procrastinating for nearly two years, I asked myself the capital question \u2014 do I really want to do engineering? And when I mouthed this question aloud, I felt a wave of regret wash over me. I knew that I was late in asking this question. Answers can wait but questions must not. Questions are ever present to be asked. And then one by one, questions that I had been evading for a long time broke the roof of self-deception, tumbling out of the dark corners of my mind. Why did I enroll in a coaching class? Didn\u2019t I know even then that I hated JEE preparation? Didn\u2019t I long for those few minutes every night when I could paint something or read a book? I felt as though every hour of preparation that I had painstakingly devoted to clear the JEE had been an utter waste of my resources. As I sat there at the bus stop, scanning the clouds for much needed solace, I noticed a familiar figure trudging along the sidewalk. With an umbrella to protect himself from the wrath of the rain gods, my father steadily approached the bus stand. I noticed an almost imperceptible limp and a silent struggle in his walk. He was panting when he reached me. He was not like this two years before. \u201cHow did you know that I would be here?\u201d, I asked. \u201cYou have come here three times in the past. All these visits were preceded by events that I believe were stressful to you. I guessed today was another such day\u201d, my father replied. \u201cThat is a good line of reasoning\u201d. \u201cNo. Not at all\u201d, he said. \u201cContrarily, it is a very weak argument. That is precisely why I said that it was a guess. Remember the adage, correlation does not imply causation.\u201d And then he sat beside me, giving me solace that the clouds had denied. He was simply sitting there, looking at the people and busses that were passing by. Not a word was spoken. I have been in the presence of great orators and entertaining conversationalists. I have seen people floor me with their exuberance. I have seen knowledgeable men and women impress me with their erudition. But I have never seen anyone like my father comfort me with the sheer profundity of silence. One can be silent by being indifferent. One can be silent because of anger. But this was not mere silence, this was a display of camaraderie through the language of silence. Here was a person sitting by my side who was a friend more than a father. \u201cAppa\u201d, I began, in a tremulous voice. \u201cI failed.\u201d He continued to remain silent for a few more seconds. \u201cDo you mind if I talk to you for some time?\u201d I shook my head. Talking was very painful. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say bus stands offer the perfect setting for what I want to talk about, but we can remain here if it suits you. Just nod if you don\u2019t mind going for a walk.\u201d I nodded. \u201cAll right, then. Let us get going.\u201d Appa and I stepped out into the rain, the two of us huddled together under the protection of the umbrella. We walked till the end of the road and on Appa\u2019s suggestion, stepped into a narrow lane. This was one of the many small streets that connect main roads in Chennai. I used to frequent this road when I was young. The silent and somewhat deserted lane has always attracted me. \u201cWhat I am going to say now may make sense to you, or it may sound like utter nonsense. But patiently hear me out. It may all sound too familiar, cliched. Sometimes cliches work, in fact most of the times they do. That is why they are popular. I will present to you my thoughts and leave them hanging there. Look at it as raw data, as information, take time to process it. If you feel that there is only junk- which is highly unlikely as there is something of value in everything - then feel free to send them to the trash. Are we fine on this point?\u201d I again nodded. \u201cLast week I read a wonderful quote by J.B.S Haldane, a British polymath who settled in India.\u201d He whipped out his smartphone and with a soft sweeping motion unlocked the phone and began reading out, relishing every word he was speaking, giving each word the time it demanded to sink into the listener. I suppose the process of acceptance will pass through the usual four stages: i) This is worthless nonsense, ii) This is an interesting, but perverse, point of view, iii) This is true, but quite unimportant, iv) I always said so. I read this and reread this. I have passed through the exact stages mentioned here countless times before. We all have a belief system to begin with. This system is a set of opinions, biases, prejudices, cherished ideas and to some extent our idiosyncrasies as well. We strongly hold that the contents of our belief system are immutable. Some of us acknowledge that there will be different belief systems for different people. Some fail to see that this is the case. What happens as we age? We see our belief systems crumble. This is quite natural. What I wanted to do 10 years back would seem childish to me now. I wanted to direct a movie when I was 20 years old. I had even applied to a film institute towards that end. And then suddenly it all vanished one day. Puff! I have always had a fascination for mathematics. Two years into engineering I thought of doing mathematics and dropped the idea then. I then thought of pursuing it after I got a job. The idea of quitting my job and doing mathematics fascinated me. And mind you I was fascinated by mathematics and mathematicians but not really passionate about doing mathematics. To that end, I made my life at office miserable. I tried to recollect all the negative experiences I had had at the workplace to provide enough justification to quit the job. We want to prove that we are right about something and marshall all the evidence we can find to justify our stand even if an overwhelming proportion of them convincingly prove otherwise. The human mind is very powerful in this regard. In the past I have been at the workplace hating every second of time spent there; and I have been at the very same building, sitting at the same desk, doing the same work, loving every second of it and wanting to do more. Wait, let me read out another quote, this one from the man who saw in a falling apple what generations of thinkers had failed to see. I was like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me. That is precisely the attitude one needs to have. Do you see what is striking about this quote? In it Newton states several important things. I would attach the following tags to this quote: curiosity, humility, beauty, progress. If interpreted in a very dry sense, Newton is stating that he knows that he doesn\u2019t know much about the world we live in. This realization that there is so much out there that we don\u2019t know and that, unlike Newton, we don\u2019t acknowledge what we don\u2019t know, struck me very late in life. The greats know their limitations, while the not-so-greats aka the common man deludes himself with half ripe knowledge. In this regard, there is another striking statement made by Sri Aurobindo, the great rishi of modern India, in the opening paragraph of his book Essays on the Gita. I love this sentence and would like you to read it. First let us find a place to sit. How about Annaji park?\u201d \u201cThat would be good\u201d, I replied. Annaji park was a five minute walk from the small lane we were in. My bad mood had somewhat lifted, the receding clouds had probably played a role in my mood swings. It was still raining as we reached the park. But thankfully, there was a quiet place to sit with a roof over the top. Annaji park which is otherwise a very lively place looked deserted. Rain and the cricket match had driven parents and children home so that the park was left to the two of us. I was beginning to get interested in what Appa was saying. He used to quote Sri Aurobindo very often. He no longer does that as presumably he sensed that none of us at home were really enthused about them. Books are his constant companions. I never really fancied reading any of those philosophical books. Each book is about 500 pages long and demands great concentration to read even a few pages. Something was different today. I was glad that Appa wanted me to read a passage from it. He handed over the smartphone to me saying, \u201cI seldom read from smartphones and other devices that try to take the place of my books. But there are utilities that such devices provide and it would be foolish to not take advantage of them. Read it out aloud if you don\u2019t mind. Let me hear it from your mouth.\u201d The World abounds with scriptures, sacred and profane, with revelations and half-revelations, with religions and philosophies, sects and schools and systems. To these the many minds of a half-ripe knowledge or no knowledge at all attach themselves with exclusiveness and passion and will have it that this or the other book alone is the eternal Word of God and all others are either impostures or at best imperfectly inspired, that this or that philosophy is the last word of the reasoning intellect and other systems are either errors or saved only by such partial truth in them as links them to the one true philosophical cult. \u201cRead it once more if you wish. Sri Aurobindo often compresses multiple ideas in a single line. Some of his lines can seem like entire paragraphs.\u201d After I had spent a sufficient time on the passage, Appa continued, \u201cThough Sri Aurobindo is referring to scriptures in these lines, they have very great applicability to all fields of human endeavour. Look for instance at politics and the hundred ideologies and political organizations that we see around us, each guarding its opinion with a fierce intensity.\u201d Appa was quiet for sometime. I was trying to make sense of what he was saying. I was more cheerful now. Appa\u2019s presence was having a positive effect on me. For the half hour that we had been out on the rainy streets, he had not uttered a word about JEE. He was reading out passages from the most unlikely sources in a casual, unhurried manner which had a calming effect. It was mildly drizzling. I suggested that we go for a walk around the park. \u201cDo you like rules?\u201d, Appa asked, as we were into our second round. \u201cI don\u2019t mind them.\u201d \u201cConsider this statement: Shun extremes, embrace moderation.\u201d \u201cThat sounds cliche?\u201d Appa chuckled, \u201cTrue. I am not denying that. But so what? Every fact of life, every great principle has already been uttered by great minds before us. Posterity must never forget that all generations prior to them have had an equal share of great men, of the same quality and character as we see around us today. Brilliant minds have roamed the Earth during its darkest hours. He who discovered the wheel is no less imaginative than the pioneers of the Internet revolution. In fact the cave dweller\u2019s discoveries were more fundamental than the invention of the iPhone.\u201d The clouds were clearing. Two of us walking under an umbrella was not exactly a great experience, but I didn\u2019t mind the minor discomfort. Appa didn\u2019t seem to have any problems. Even if he did, he didn\u2019t express it. \u201cGood old proverbs. If only man knew the art of application, the ability to act on great proverbs, the world would be a much better place. Life is short. There is no denying that. Which means, the one greatest resource that all of us have is time. You aren\u2019t going to get it back. Never. You know why I am saying this.\u201d We had stopped walking now. Appa suggested that we sit for a while before going home. \u201cJEE is a tough examination.\" I knew that this was coming. \"I know that\", I said. Why did he have to bring it up now? \"Yes. But there are more challenging ones that life will throw at you. And none of this preparation will help. That is the beauty of it all. At that point we must be prepared to fail, to fall and not get dejected if it is steeper than the ones you have encountered before. So why was I talking about shunning extremes? It is simple. Avoid stressing yourself. Note that you must never miss the chance of exceeding yourself, of becoming better, as The Mother of Sri Aurobindo Ashram says. That is a love for progress which is altogether different from overexerting yourself. But to be obsessed about something, to the extent that your happiness hinges on the achievement or procurement of the object of obsession, is terrible. I don\u2019t believe in raw passion. Those who mindlessly slog for JEE are in the end doing just that. How many of these kids really know what they are getting into? For them, the end matters. The means are never questioned. People say that you must do whatever it takes to reach the shore. That is ridiculous.\u201d \u201cTake this from me: See the world around you. Remember that the means are as important as the ends, if not more. You must grow as an individual. That must be your aim. Medicine, engineering, law, journalism and the thousand and one streams that are out there are merely passing stages in your life. As you grow older, the world will start defining you by your vocation. Never submit to that. A vocation is a means. You are more than your job. You are more than the marks you score. The whole is always greater than the sum of the parts. Never forget this. You are an integral whole, a being with multiple identities and tendencies. Your true glory lies in harnessing all these powers, in giving each its due attention. Not a narrow specialization, but a broad perfection must be your aim. What happened to the painter in you? You used to play cricket. Where is the enthusiasm of the child that I used to see in you? Why should that childlike curiosity disappear as we age? Seriousness in life is important, but it must not be confused with extreme graveness. That large vision which sees life in one whole sweep is essential. Only that can save you. There can be bad days, bad weeks and bad months. But the sum total of your life will always be more glorious, filled with sunshine and laughter. It is in this mean-state that you should dwell. Above all I want you to rediscover yourself. Let Sri Aurobindo be your guide in this. These are his lovely words of advice. It looks as though he has specially crafted them for you: \u201cEvery man has in him something divine, something his own, a chance of strength and perfection in however small a sphere, which God offers him to take or refuse. The task is to find it, develop it, use it.\u201d \u201cFind it. Even if it takes a lifetime, find it.\u201d There was a long silence. Appa quietly sat beside me, one hand around on my shoulder, the other around the drenched umbrella, turning it in his hands in a slow repetitive manner. The intensity of his words were yet to sink in. I didn\u2019t catch all of what he said. But I was satisfied with the emotions it evoked in me. That was all that mattered. The dark, depressing feelings that had occupied much of my day had disappeared. So did the clouds. It had stopped raining. The sun was out again. Back at Chepauk, Dravid and Laxman were putting their pads back on, ready to face Warne's flighted deliveries. We slowly got up and made our way towards the gate. I looked back at the empty park and realised that I may never experience another moment like this in my life. There was a pang in my heart as I left the park with Appa. The last hour had been one of pure magic. We steadily made our way back home. I hit the bell twice on reaching the doorstep. \u201cWhere have the two of you been\u201d, asked Amma, clearly angry at our uninformed absence. \u201cMy son fancied a walk at this beautiful hour. I gave him company\u201d, Appa said, smiling at me. \u201cWhy were you silent on our way back\u201d, I asked. \u201cThere are moments in life when silence is of infinitely greater value than speech. I could feel that our walk back was one such moment for the two of us. Why would I spoilt that?\u201d And with that he disappeared into the bathroom with a towel in his hand while I rushed inside my room to find the paint brush that I had not touched in ages.","title":"Wisdom Under an Umbrella"},{"location":"stories/story_1/#wisdom-under-an-umbrella","text":"The sky is overcast.

He used to quote Sri Aurobindo very often. He no longer does that as presumably he sensed that none of us at home were really enthused about them. Books are his constant companions. I never really fancied reading any of those philosophical books. Each book is about 500 pages long and demands great concentration to read even a few pages. Something was different today. I was glad that Appa wanted me to read a passage from it. He handed over the smartphone to me saying, \u201cI seldom read from smartphones and other devices that try to take the place of my books. But there are utilities that such devices provide and it would be foolish to not take advantage of them. Read it out aloud if you don\u2019t mind. Let me hear it from your mouth.\u201d The World abounds with scriptures, sacred and profane, with revelations and half-revelations, with religions and philosophies, sects and schools and systems. To these the many minds of a half-ripe knowledge or no knowledge at all attach themselves with exclusiveness and passion and will have it that this or the other book alone is the eternal Word of God and all others are either impostures or at best imperfectly inspired, that this or that philosophy is the last word of the reasoning intellect and other systems are either errors or saved only by such partial truth in them as links them to the one true philosophical cult. \u201cRead it once more if you wish. Sri Aurobindo often compresses multiple ideas in a single line. Some of his lines can seem like entire paragraphs.\u201d After I had spent a sufficient time on the passage, Appa continued, \u201cThough Sri Aurobindo is referring to scriptures in these lines, they have very great applicability to all fields of human endeavour. Look for instance at politics and the hundred ideologies and political organizations that we see around us, each guarding its opinion with a fierce intensity.\u201d Appa was quiet for sometime. I was trying to make sense of what he was saying. I was more cheerful now. Appa\u2019s presence was having a positive effect on me. For the half hour that we had been out on the rainy streets, he had not uttered a word about JEE. He was reading out passages from the most unlikely sources in a casual, unhurried manner which had a calming effect. It was mildly drizzling. I suggested that we go for a walk around the park. \u201cDo you like rules?\u201d, Appa asked, as we were into our second round. \u201cI don\u2019t mind them.\u201d \u201cConsider this statement: Shun extremes, embrace moderation.\u201d \u201cThat sounds cliche?\u201d Appa chuckled, \u201cTrue. I am not denying that. But so what? Every fact of life, every great principle has already been uttered by great minds before us. Posterity must never forget that all generations prior to them have had an equal share of great men, of the same quality and character as we see around us today. Brilliant minds have roamed the Earth during its darkest hours. He who discovered the wheel is no less imaginative than the pioneers of the Internet revolution. In fact the cave dweller\u2019s discoveries were more fundamental than the invention of the iPhone.\u201d The clouds were clearing. Two of us walking under an umbrella was not exactly a great experience, but I didn\u2019t mind the minor discomfort. Appa didn\u2019t seem to have any problems. Even if he did, he didn\u2019t express it. \u201cGood old proverbs. If only man knew the art of application, the ability to act on great proverbs, the world would be a much better place. Life is short. There is no denying that. Which means, the one greatest resource that all of us have is time. You aren\u2019t going to get it back. Never. You know why I am saying this.\u201d We had stopped walking now. Appa suggested that we sit for a while before going home. \u201cJEE is a tough examination.\" I knew that this was coming. \"I know that\", I said. Why did he have to bring it up now? \"Yes. But there are more challenging ones that life will throw at you. And none of this preparation will help. That is the beauty of it all. At that point we must be prepared to fail, to fall and not get dejected if it is steeper than the ones you have encountered before. So why was I talking about shunning extremes? It is simple. Avoid stressing yourself. Note that you must never miss the chance of exceeding yourself, of becoming better, as The Mother of Sri Aurobindo Ashram says. That is a love for progress which is altogether different from overexerting yourself. But to be obsessed about something, to the extent that your happiness hinges on the achievement or procurement of the object of obsession, is terrible. I don\u2019t believe in raw passion. Those who mindlessly slog for JEE are in the end doing just that. How many of these kids really know what they are getting into? For them, the end matters. The means are never questioned. People say that you must do whatever it takes to reach the shore. That is ridiculous.\u201d \u201cTake this from me: See the world around you. Remember that the means are as important as the ends, if not more. You must grow as an individual. That must be your aim. Medicine, engineering, law, journalism and the thousand and one streams that are out there are merely passing stages in your life. As you grow older, the world will start defining you by your vocation. Never submit to that. A vocation is a means. You are more than your job. You are more than the marks you score. The whole is always greater than the sum of the parts. Never forget this. You are an integral whole, a being with multiple identities and tendencies. Your true glory lies in harnessing all these powers, in giving each its due attention. Not a narrow specialization, but a broad perfection must be your aim. What happened to the painter in you? You used to play cricket. Where is the enthusiasm of the child that I used to see in you? Why should that childlike curiosity disappear as we age? Seriousness in life is important, but it must not be confused with extreme graveness. That large vision which sees life in one whole sweep is essential. Only that can save you. There can be bad days, bad weeks and bad months. But the sum total of your life will always be more glorious, filled with sunshine and laughter. It is in this mean-state that you should dwell. Above all I want you to rediscover yourself. Let Sri Aurobindo be your guide in this. These are his lovely words of advice. It looks as though he has specially crafted them for you: \u201cEvery man has in him something divine, something his own, a chance of strength and perfection in however small a sphere, which God offers him to take or refuse. The task is to find it, develop it, use it.\u201d \u201cFind it. Even if it takes a lifetime, find it.\u201d There was a long silence. Appa quietly sat beside me, one hand around on my shoulder, the other around the drenched umbrella, turning it in his hands in a slow repetitive manner. The intensity of his words were yet to sink in. I didn\u2019t catch all of what he said. But I was satisfied with the emotions it evoked in me. That was all that mattered. The dark, depressing feelings that had occupied much of my day had disappeared. So did the clouds. It had stopped raining. The sun was out again. Back at Chepauk, Dravid and Laxman were putting their pads back on, ready to face Warne's flighted deliveries. We slowly got up and made our way towards the gate. I looked back at the empty park and realised that I may never experience another moment like this in my life. There was a pang in my heart as I left the park with Appa. The last hour had been one of pure magic. We steadily made our way back home. I hit the bell twice on reaching the doorstep. \u201cWhere have the two of you been\u201d, asked Amma, clearly angry at our uninformed absence. \u201cMy son fancied a walk at this beautiful hour. I gave him company\u201d, Appa said, smiling at me. \u201cWhy were you silent on our way back\u201d, I asked. \u201cThere are moments in life when silence is of infinitely greater value than speech. I could feel that our walk back was one such moment for the two of us. Why would I spoilt that?\u201d And with that he disappeared into the bathroom with a towel in his hand while I rushed inside my room to find the paint brush that I had not touched in ages.","title":"Wisdom Under an Umbrella"}]}
